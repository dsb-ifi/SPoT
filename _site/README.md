# Project Website

This repository updates the [jekyllized version](https://github.com/shunzh/project_website) of the source code for the [Nerfies website](https://nerfies.github.io).
You only need to change the content of [index.md](/index.md). 
It's possible to only write in markdown, but you can also use HTML to achieve fancier effects.

Here is an [example website](https://shunzh.github.io/project_website/).

## Test it locally

Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), and run
```
jekyll serve
```
in this directory.

Then you can see the website at `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.

## To use it

You need to copy the `gh-pages` branch into your repository and update the [index.md](/index.md)
